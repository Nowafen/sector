    -d, --domain {domain}
     Specify a single target domain (e.g., example.com)
  
    -l, --list {file}
    Specify a file containing a list of domains to scan (e.g., file-domains.txt)
  
    -vhost {ip}
    Specify an IP for virtual host scanning (e.g., http://5.5.5.5)
  
    -nc, --nuclei
    Perform advanced scanning to uncover potential attack vectors
  
    -pd, --parameter-discovery
    Identify hidden URL parameters to expand attack surface
  
    -sjf, --smart-js-fuzzer
    Enhance JS file discovery to broaden attack surface coverage
  
    -dbf, --dns-bruteforce
    Enable comprehensive DNS enumeration (requires -dbw and -dbr)
  
    -dbw, --dns-bruteforce-wordlist {file}
    Specify wordlist file for DNS enumeration (e.g., wordlist.txt)
  
    -dbr, --dns-bruteforce-resolvers {file}
    Specify resolvers file for DNS enumeration (e.g., resolvers.txt)
  
    -t, --thread {low|medium|high}
    Control parallel execution: low (2 tasks), medium (3 tasks, may stress the OS), high (all tasks, can heavily stress the OS (Default: None))
  
    -up, --update
    Update the tool to the latest version
  
    -h, --help
    Display this help menu
    
    Examples:
    sector -d google.com -t medium
